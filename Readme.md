In this project we create a simple Python code to connect to Mongo DB to perform Semantic Search. 

We use Hugger face LLM to generated vector embeddings and store these embeddings in MongoDB. The using Vector Search aggregation pipeline we perform transform the given query to vector embeddings and match it agains the embeddings stored in the MongoDB to perform the Semantic Semantic.
